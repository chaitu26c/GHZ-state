GHZ State | Quantum Computing
The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is an important entangled quantum state that involves multiple qubits. It represents a maximally entangled state of three or more qubits and is widely used in quantum information theory, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing experiments.

Definition
For n qubits, the GHZ state is defined as:

∣
GHZ
𝑛
⟩
=
1
2
(
∣
0
⟩
⊗
𝑛
+
∣
1
⟩
⊗
𝑛
)
∣GHZ 
n
​
 ⟩= 
2
​
 
1
​
 (∣0⟩ 
⊗n
 +∣1⟩ 
⊗n
 )
For example, in a three-qubit system, the GHZ state is:

∣
GHZ
3
⟩
=
1
2
(
∣
000
⟩
+
∣
111
⟩
)
∣GHZ 
3
​
 ⟩= 
2
​
 
1
​
 (∣000⟩+∣111⟩)
Properties
Maximal Entanglement: All qubits are strongly correlated, meaning that measuring one qubit determines the state of all others.
Nonlocality: The GHZ state exhibits strong nonlocal correlations that defy classical explanations.
Quantum Superposition: The system exists in a coherent superposition of all qubits being in state |0⟩ and all qubits being in state |1⟩.
Applications
Quantum Cryptography: GHZ states are useful for protocols like quantum secret sharing.
Quantum Teleportation: They enhance the efficiency of multi-party quantum teleportation schemes.
Quantum Error Correction: GHZ states are used in error-correcting codes for fault-tolerant quantum computing.
Bell Test Experiments: They demonstrate violations of local realism in quantum mechanics.
