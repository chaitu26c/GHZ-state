This repository Demonstrates the quantum circuit of GHZ state using Qiskit.


GHZ State | Quantum Computing
The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is an important entangled quantum state that involves multiple qubits. It represents a maximally entangled state of three or more qubits and is widely used in quantum information theory, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing experiments.

Properties
Maximal Entanglement: All qubits are strongly correlated, meaning that measuring one qubit determines the state of all others.
Nonlocality: The GHZ state exhibits strong nonlocal correlations that defy classical explanations.
Quantum Superposition: The system exists in a coherent superposition of all qubits being in state |0⟩ and all qubits being in state |1⟩.
Applications
Quantum Cryptography: GHZ states are useful for protocols like quantum secret sharing.
Quantum Teleportation: They enhance the efficiency of multi-party quantum teleportation schemes.
Quantum Error Correction: GHZ states are used in error-correcting codes for fault-tolerant quantum computing.
Bell Test Experiments: They demonstrate violations of local realism in quantum mechanics.
